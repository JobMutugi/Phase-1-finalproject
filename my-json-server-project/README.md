# My JSON Server Project

This project sets up a simple JSON server using `json-server`. It allows you to create a mock REST API with minimal configuration.

## Installation

To install the necessary dependencies, including `json-server`, run the following command in your project directory:

```
npm install json-server
```

## Usage

To start the JSON server, you can use the following command:

```
npx json-server --watch db.json
```

This command will start the server and watch for changes in the `db.json` file.

## Configuration

- **src/index.js**: This is the entry point of the JSON server. It contains the code to start the server and configure any necessary middleware or routes.
- **db.json**: This file serves as the database for the JSON server. It contains the data in JSON format that the server will serve.
- **package.json**: This file lists the dependencies and scripts for starting the server.
